Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#108 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -7.694 ns between sig_baudrate_reg[1]_replica/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and sig_baudrate_cycles_reg[20]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
